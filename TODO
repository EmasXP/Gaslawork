STEP 1
- Write tests for fetching parameters
- Write tests and documentation for App:
	- Controller::__invoke()
	- 404 exceptions
	- Action prefix & suffix
- Finalize the docuentation:
	- nginx: https://docs.koseven.ga/guide/kohana/tutorials/clean-urls
	- Controllers & Actions
	- Dependency injection
	- Hello world
	- Views
	- Database
	- Configuration
- Tips & Tricks
	- Extend Route to set defaults on suffix/prefix or namespace prefix
	- Performance tweaks:
		- Help composer by manually including Gaslawork files
		- Composer optimize
- array() -> []
- Go though the code:
	- Can some methods be improved or split apart?
	- Add comments on methods and classes
- Add to Packagist


STEP 2
- Documentation
	- Write about all the things that are missing in the documentation
	- Maybe the documentation can be more fun?


STEP 3
- Response::redirect()?
- Response::status()?

- Controller:
	- Fetch param from dummy route via $this->get_param()
		- That exist
		- That does not exist
	- Fetch params from dummy route via $this->get_params()
	- Fetch dependency via controller
