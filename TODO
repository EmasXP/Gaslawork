STEP 1
- 404 exceptions
    - Test non-404
    - Test default rendered 404
    - Test custom rendered 404
- Rename Routes to Router?
- Write tests for fetching parameters
- Write tests for App:
    - Using container
- Write tests and documentation for App:
	- Controller::__invoke()
	- Action prefix & suffix
- Finalize the documentation:
	- nginx: https://docs.koseven.ga/guide/kohana/tutorials/clean-urls
	- Controllers & Actions
	- Views
	- Database
	- Configuration
    - Exception handling
    - "\Controller\\" should be "\\Controller\\"
- Tips & Tricks
	- Extend Route to set defaults on suffix/prefix or namespace prefix
	- Performance tweaks:
		- Help composer by manually including Gaslawork files
		- Composer optimize
- array() -> []
- Go though the code:
	- Can some methods be improved or split apart?
	- Add comments on methods and classes
- Add to Packagist


STEP 2
- Documentation
	- Write about all the things that are missing in the documentation
	- Maybe the documentation can be more fun?
- A way of fetching the request body. Request::getBody() maybe.
- Even faster - less dynamic - routes
- A REST Route and Controller


STEP 3
- Response::redirect()?
- Response::json()?
- Request::jsonBody()? Request::getJsonBody()?
- Container::__construct(array $entries = null)?


TESTS TO WRITE:
- Controller:
	- Fetch param from dummy route via $this->get_param()
		- That exist
		- That does not exist
	- Fetch params from dummy route via $this->get_params()
	- Fetch dependency via controller
	- Fetch dependency that does not exist via controller
- App::validControllerPath()
